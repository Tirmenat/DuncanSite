									<small>Max Geraci will be the 2B RA for the 2013-14 academic year. A mechanical engineering major here at ND, Max likes to take every chance he can get to get away from school life and enjoy the outdoors. This includes fly fishing, kung fu, hiking, camping, and just about anything else under the sun. Born and raised in Colorado, Max has three siblings; two older brothers, and a younger sister. He has a tendency to be a bit of a goof, so if you hear loud noises in the hallways or late night arguments about which food would win if spaghetti and fettuccini were animate beings…odds are that’s probably him. He is looking forward to his last year here at ND and confident that it will be the best yet.</small>

									<small>My name is Matthew Romano, and I will be the 2A RA for Duncan Hall this upcoming year. Feel free to stop by anytime to talk or hang out, my door is always open. I am currently a senior at the University of Notre Dame, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Corporate Practice. I am originally from Stuart, FL (about 2 hours from Miami on the east coast) and love anything to do with water or the outdoors. This past summer, I had my first internship with GE Lighting in Cleveland,. I worked on designing different types of LED replacement light bulbs. I love basically anything Notre Dame related and I'm a die hard ND football fan. I am the Co-president of the Peer Mentors for the College of Engineering on campus, so if you have any questions about anything engineering related, feel free to come talk to me. I chose to come to Notre Dame because I love the tradition, the school spirit, the combination of academics and athletics, and I wanted to experience something other than summer all the time. I look forward to meeting you all and hanging out with everything this upcoming year. Have a great summer, and GO IRISH!</small>

								<div class="span8 pull-left">
									<small>Hi my name is Peter White and I'm am going to be the RA in 3A  for the upcoming year. I'm from Philadelphia, PA and am one of five kids. My brother graduated from ND last year and I have a sister who is going to be a junior in Ryan Hall. I  am a Marketing and Television Production double major, if that is at all interesting... I have done a lot of service projects at ND including Appalachia, Teamwork for Tomorrow, volunteering at the Robinson Center and at ECDC, so I'm basically a really good person. I've also been on the Freshman Orientation staff and helped with The Freshman Retreat. I've been abroad in the summer London program, but you can't beat South Bend, especially in the winter. I've previously served as the Vice President of Duncan Hall in my sophomore year and have been heavily involved in student government since I arrived at ND. Other things I love- the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Flyers, T-Swift music, sleep, and Netflix (I watch a lot of TV). That's about it for now. I can't wait to meet everyone in a few weeks, you'll recognize me as the best looking RA there.</small>
